# prgsbots
This repository contains code to write bots using Microsoft bot framework. This contains codes for three bots listed below:
* prgs_bot : answers to queries related to customer details and order details.
* warehouse_bot : answers to queries related to item sales.
* notification_bot : which triggers notification to the intended users based on some configuration

#Microsoft Bot Framework
The framework offers tools and services to build and connect intelligent bots through various messaging channels. Most of the connectivity and messaging infrastructure is already built in to the framework, yet it provides enough flexibility to write up your own logic on how to respond to the various Intents.

Refer to the [Bot Framework Documentation] (http://docs.botframework.com/)

The Framework provides integration to many messaging channels including slack, skype, FB messenger, webchat and directline (where you can write your own custom client).

You can view all possible messaging channel integration on the Bot details page.

#Getting Started
You need to have a microsoft account to register your bots and use the integration features of the framework. The framework is pretty intuitive and self guiding in how to proceed further. 

Here is the link to start with your first bot. [Developer Console] (https://dev.botframework.com/bots)
